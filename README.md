## Data loading and cleaning

The data set contains survey responses from 2131 individuals regarding
demographic factors (age, sex, race, ect.), the types of apps they use,
time spent on different devices, preferred type of media, and other
issues regarding media consumption.

The first step is converting factor variables to features and converting
answers to a question that was reported in multiple columns to one
column

``` r
masterDF <- read.csv('data/DeloitteMediaConsumptionSurvey.csv')
str(demographicDF)
```
